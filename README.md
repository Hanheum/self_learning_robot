self learning robot

clinet(robot) sends images that can be used as dataset and server gets the images. It doesn't do the tensorflow learning part yet because the model should have high accuracy on detecting the target, but the accuracy is not that high yet. But once the accuracy becomes high enough and the robot itself is also adapted to multiple environments, it will be able to adapt to new environment in few minutes.
